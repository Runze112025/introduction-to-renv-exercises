# introduction-to-renv-exercises

This repo is the companion to the [Introduction to renv](https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-renv/) tutorial. It contains exercises to help you practice using renv.

## Forking this Repo

To complete the exercises in this repository, we recommend forking this repo.

If you have already completed the [Introduction to version Control with git and GitHub within RStudio](https://lmu-osc.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/) tutorial, your computer already be set up to complete everything needed for forking.

If you have not completed that tutorial *or* you have not independently set-up git and GitHub, then you can skip to the Zip File section below.

### Forking

GitHub provides thorough, but also relatively brief, [instructions on how to fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) and beginning using it. For this exercise, you only need to concern yourself with the [Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) and [Cloning your forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) sub-sections.


### Zip File

If you run into problems with forking *or* cloning, then you can download this repo as a `.zip` file by pressing the green "Code" drop down button above and selecting the "Download ZIP" button.

The downside to this is that you won't be able to `git pull` changes in the future, and, more importantly, you will not be able to push your progress to GitHub or open Pull Requests for instructors to review. (That said, review by an instructor is in no way required.)

## Instructions

The instructions for each exercise are in the README file in the corresponding exercise folder. 

If you wish to have an instructor review your work, please first fork this repository to your own GitHub account. Then, complete the exercises and push your changes to your forked repository. Finally, submit a pull request to the original repository.

# R Version Requirement

You will not be able to complete all steps in the `restore-exercises` repo if you do not have version 4.4.X of R installed.
